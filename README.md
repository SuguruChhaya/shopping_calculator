# shopping_calculator

This is a project in which you can add items to your shopping list and ultimately calculate the total cost.
You can add, edit, save, and delete items.
I have mainly used python classes to manage data for evey item.

(Yes, I know that the app can look better in terms of appearance.)

Anyways, I hope you find this app interesting!!
